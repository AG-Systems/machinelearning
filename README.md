Libraries to learn: tensorflow & scikit learn

List of algorithms I know:
  
    Linear Regression
  
    K Nearest Neighbors

    Support Vector Machines 
    
    K-Means 
    
    Mean shift

    Decision Trees
    
    Naive Bayes

Other plans:

     Learn linear algebra (LOL I KNOW RIGHT)
     
     Learn stats
     
     Combine tensorflow & django (Harder then I thought)
     
     Rails & Tensorflow (The dream, maybe one day)
